                    <h2>What is vintage old cars?</h2>
                    <p>A vintage car is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on.There’s more than just age that separates a classic car from an antique. With all the terminology and jargon we’ve seen thrown around by experienced and beginner collectors alike, it’s important to know the key differences between each type of car.  
        
                        We’ve been working with collector vehicles for over 40 years and have often heard from confused owners, which is why we had our experts put together a handful of the most important distinctions between vintages and classics, as well as classics and antique car classifications.</p>

                        <h2>History</h2>
                        <p>History. The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s.
                        The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s. In the intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, the ability to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of automotive design.
        
                        Cars became much more practical, convenient and comfortable during this period. Car heating was introduced (progressing from hot bricks via double-skinned exhaust manifolds to the heater radiator matrix), as was the in-car radio. Four-wheel braking from a common foot pedal was introduced, as was the use of hydraulically actuated brakes.
