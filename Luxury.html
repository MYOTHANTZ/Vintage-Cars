                <p>

The models built after 1974, lost the classic appearance, they were so well-known for. Although the production terminated in 1989, it still continues its production in the Porsche line-up.</p>

                <p>
                    
                    The ultimate Prancing Horse was one of the extremely rare cars between 1962 and 1964 because there were only 39 of them. Very few people had the chance to own this vehicle. It's also very surprising that they even exist today. It claims the record for being the most expensive car ever publicly auctioned, at a whopping $48,4 million. It is the best car Ferrari ever made and it was used in many historic race championships.

                <p>
                    

                    Introduced in 1954, this car is a classic among the sports cars and also the fastest production car of its time. This million-dollar vintage car was launched at the New York International Motor Show in 1954. It has captivated its audience with its beauty and elegance for over 60 years and the innovative door design can be credited for the same. It was designed with impressive aerodynamics and a first for Mercedes with a fuel injected engine that had never been seen before. Unfortunately, it had a very short span of production.

                    It is nearly impossible to finish this list of luxury vintage cars without a Rolls Royce in it. Keeping the idea of luxury in mind, this car was launched in 1949 and was retired in 1954. It was a stunning vehicle with a limited availability and was back into the market after the world war. It was discontinued for many years and the car maker introduced a successor model after a 60 years hiatus. It may well be the most sporting and dramatic coachwork ever.

                <p>
                    

                    With the intention to build a unique and sleek supercar, this car was every bit unique, sleek and super. This car was brought to life by BMW and Lamborghini. It was built as a motorsport competition model that would be a rival for Porsche. It was brought into the market between 1978 to 1981 and couldn't meet the competition requirements and only a total of 453 were hand-built in its history.

                    These cars might be loud, expensive to maintain, and not be as fast, or easy to handle as their modern counterparts yet they have made their mark in the automotive history and given us a million different reasons to celebrate them.
